\section{\faUsers\ Projects}
\datedsubsection{Connection between Adversarial Training and Regularization}{Dec. 2018}
Adversarial training is a technique for making machine learning models robust to adversarial attacks. In this project, we explored adversarial training from the generalization perspective to find the connection between adversarial training and regularization. The experimental results show that the adversarial training has the regularization effect.

\datedsubsection{Facial Age and Gender Estimation}{Mar. 2018}
Designed, built and trained the convolutional neural network model to classify facial images. Implemented real-time age and gender estimation app using python and OpenCV.
