\section{\faCogs\ Other Experience}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Espial Group}, Ottawa}{Jan. 2017 -- Aug. 2017}
\role{Coop Software Developer}

Assisted in porting existing code and automated the nightly build deployment process.

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Corsa Technology}, Ottawa}{Sept. 2016 -- Dec. 2016}
\role{Coop Software Developer}

Developed Python scripts to automate sanity tests of the SDN switch products.

\section{\faUsers\ Engineering Project}
\datedsubsection{Facial Age and Gender Estimation}{Mar. 2018}
Designed, built and trained the convolutional neural network model to classify facial images

\datedsubsection{Simple Search Engine}{Feb. 2018}
In this project, I developed a web crawler and a document analyzer to parse and rate web content. The page rank algorithm is implemented to prevent spam. Services are provided to client through RESTful APIs.

\datedsubsection{Android Group Chat App}{Nov. 2017}
In this project, an android group chat app is implemented which allows users to chat in groups. Image and text messages are supported by this app. The server is setup using the Firebase technology. 

\section{\faUsers\ Research Project}
\datedsubsection{Connection between Adversarial Training and Regularization}{Dec. 2018}
In this project, we explored adversarial training from the generalization perspective to find the connection between adversarial training and regularization.

\datedsubsection{A More Human Understandable Approach to Word Embeddings}{Apr. 2019}
The purpose of this project is to explore options for addressing the human interpretability problem of existing word embedding algorithms. Our proposal is to address this issue by adding human input to the word embedding training process.
